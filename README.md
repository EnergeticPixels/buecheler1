What Is This?
-------------

This is a sample (quick, down and dirty) of a NodeJS, Express, Jade and MongoDB project.  Very
simple.  This application just reads This set of names and cooresponding email addresses from a db
collection and displays them in a unordered list.  There is a page for adding more names/emails
to the collection.

This examples are meant to teach you about code-level development for NodeJS.


How To Use The Examples
-----------------------

There are three main ways to interact with the examples in this project:

1. NodeJS and MongoDB installed on the client computer.

2. This is the simple sequence:

* From the Node command line, issue the npm install command.

* After NodeJS, downloads and installs the node_modules, issue
npm start.  This will start the server.

* point your browser to localhost:3000/userlist
